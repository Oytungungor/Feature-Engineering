# Feature-Engineering
I applied crucial steps of feature engineering.

## Encoding Notebook 
Encoding is the process of converting categorical data into numerical format so that machine learning algorithms can process them. Categorical data represents discrete values or categories which most machine learning models cannot directly handle. Therefore, encoding is an essential step in preparing categorical data for analysis. In this notebook, I apply encoding methods.

## Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In many machine learning algorithms, the performance and training stability of the model can be significantly improved if the numerical features are on the same scale. In this notebook, I applied feature scaling techniques such as normalization and standardization.

## Missing Value Imputation
Missing value imputation is a data preprocessing technique used to fill in missing values in a dataset. This is essential in many machine learning algorithms because missing values can lead to biased estimates, reduce model performance, and complicate the analysis process. By imputing missing values, we aim to maintain the integrity of the dataset and ensure the reliability of the results.

## Polynomial Features
Polynomial features are generated by raising the existing features to a specified power, which helps in capturing nonlinear relationships in the data. By introducing polynomial features, the model can learn more complex patterns. In this notebook, I demonstrate how to create and use polynomial features to enhance model performance.
